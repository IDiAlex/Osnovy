Round 15 years ago, I was working at my part-time job at an electronics store at the mall. One of my colleagues asked me if I /*use text messages.*/
/*I’m addicted*/ she said wide-eyed. /*They’re so much fun.*/
At that time, most people were still using old feature phones with LED screens and plastic keypads. I don’t remember what the character limits were, but it was certainly fewer than a tweet, and it took about 12 years to finally type out what you wanted to say. They were slow, very expensive, and long enough to write about a quarter of a haiku. I genuinely thought it was a dumb, flash-in-the-pan gimmick that wouldn’t last long.
How wrong I was.
The first text message /*(“Merry Christmas”)*/ was sent way back in 1992 in the UK. Text messaging spread as mobile phones became more popular in places like Japan, creeping into places like the US sometime later, but by the late 2000s, it was everywhere.
By 2012, it’s estimated that 14.7 trillion messages were sent from mobile phones worldwide. That number grew to 28.2 trillion in 2017. This technology isn’t going anywhere.
But as short message service /*(SMS)*/ and other forms of text messaging have grown to become such a core part of the way we interact with each other, they have done so at the expense of the form of digital communication that preceded it email.
It wasn’t so long ago that email was the shiny new method of staying in touch.
But our love affair with email was short-lived and many of us now have a genuine dislike of our inbox, preferring to tap out text messages until our thumbs ache. So why have we come to loathe email so much? Why is it such a source of anxiety, tedium, guilt? Why do we hate emails, but love texts?
//Formal, boring and unsolicited
Just a couple of decades ago, we were all delighted to receive emails, The Atlantic magazine points out. AOL, the internet portal that was wildly popular in the US and Canada in the 1990s, even greeted customers with a cheery// “You’ve got mail!” upon sign-in. But the novelty is long gone.
